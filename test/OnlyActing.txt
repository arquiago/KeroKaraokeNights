2.5 When I step onto the stage
2 See the curtain raise
1.5 I'm apparent
2.5 I've got someone to play
2 All the crowd are in the seats
2 Looking straight at me
1.2 For an answer
5 They just get what they see
3 They applaud and the usher's locking the door
6 Til the matinee

2 So I get to know the cast
2 Though it doesn't last
1 I'm a pro but
2.5 I won't take it too far
2 Now I know I shouldn't get
2.5 Comfy on the set
1.2 Every time it
5 All comes down in the end
3.5 That's the truth that the stage school doesn't teach you
4.9 But it's good to know

3 It takes much more than just learning a script
3.5 You see you gotta take the part and believe it
5 Oh- I sometimes make up all of my lines on the spot
6.5 But I will always give what I got

2.75 I thought I was only acting
3.75 But I felt exactly like it was all for real
2.75 I sure didn't know it hurt so
3.2 But then no rehearsal could
3.2 Show you how to feel inside
1.75 What you gotta hide
1.75 Where to put your pride
3.5 When to realise you've had your time
1.75 Find another role
5.75 Carry on the show
